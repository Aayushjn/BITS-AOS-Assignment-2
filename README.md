## Getting Started

1. Setup IntelliJ IDEA and use the Eclipse Temurin 20 JDK as the project JDK (set it as the `JAVA_HOME` optionally).
2. Build the code into a JAR file with `./gradlew jar` or use the Gradle task window on the right side of the IDE.
3. Run the JAR with `$JAVA_HOME/bin/java -jar ./build/libs/KeyValueStore-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar` (check the file name in the 
build directory).
